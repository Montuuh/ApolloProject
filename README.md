## Description

We are 3 students of second year, coursing "Disseny i desenvolupament de videojocs | TTC" provided by CITM UPC. We have been asked to develop a game emulating the Apollo Mission. The objective is going to the Moon and returning to Earth safely, but be careful, you can run out of fuel, so you will have to get some from the space! SDL Libraries have been used for this project.
